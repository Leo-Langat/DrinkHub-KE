/**
 * Dashboard Routes
 *
 * Registers the Admin Dashboard Overview endpoint.
 *
 * Authorization chain:
 *   1. authenticate       — Validates JWT, rejects invalid/expired/deprecated tokens
 *   2. authorize([ADMIN]) — Only ADMIN role is permitted (403 for all other roles)
 *   3. requireTenantScope — Resolves businessUuid from JWT into req.businessUuid
 *   4. controller         — Reads req.businessUuid, calls service, returns data
 *
 * Roles blocked:
 *   MANAGER     → 403 Insufficient permissions
 *   WAITER      → 403 Insufficient permissions
 *   CUSTOMER    → 403 Insufficient permissions
 *   SUPER_ADMIN → 403 Insufficient permissions (has own separate dashboard)
 *   Unauthenticated → 401 Unauthorized
